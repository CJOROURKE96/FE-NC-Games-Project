This is an app that reviews board games, each review has a selection of votes & comments. Both votes & comments can be interacted with by the user, with an updated UI for each. 

Clicking the main title "NC Games Reviews" returns to the homepage. Following the links set as buttons, e.g "Dexterity" will show all games with that category. 

Filtering the options via the buttons, e.g "Designer" will filter the selected options by which ever query you decided. There is also an option to order the reviews in ascending or descending order. By default, filter is set to "Title" & order is set to "DESC".
